How this game works:

1) The Score will increase once the whole particular row will be filled with pieces, if even a single space is left then the point will not be counted.
2) The game will end if the pieces are aligned and exceed the screen's top.
3) A random piece will generate each time.
4) There are a total of three buttons. A user can move the piece right, or left and rotate it according to the game situation.

This game is built purely with core flutter.
